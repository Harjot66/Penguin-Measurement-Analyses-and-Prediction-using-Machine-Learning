# Penguin-Measurement-Analyses-and-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project delves into comprehensive statistical analysis of penguin data to understand their physical attributes, population dynamics, and species differentiation. Through techniques like species stratified sampling and machine learning models, we aimed to accurately estimate penguin body mass and classify species.
